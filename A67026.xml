            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

They are not alwayes the learnedſt men that find out the greateſt myſteries: neither are they alwayes the greateſt men, by whom God bringeth the greateſt things to paſſe.

Certaine it is, there is a truth if we could find it: For God will prove himſelfe true,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.4.</note> though every man be a lyar, and therefore if any miſtake be, the fault is in our ſelves. This I hold as one principle.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96743:9"/>agree, and this I hold as a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond principle. Laſtly, I doubt not but in this controverſall age God is about to refine the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion; and to reveale ſecrets that have beene hitherto hidden: and ſeeing many other myſteries are daily cleared, why ſhould not this alſo? ſeeing that God which giveth an heart to undertake, can give power to performe; let men ſay &amp; thinke what they will, I ſhall not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faile, through his aſſiſtance, to doe my beſt indeavour.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96743:9"/>children. Where God hath not a tongue to ſpeake, we may not have an eare to heare; when he is ſparing in revealing, we muſt be ſparing in enquiring;<note place="margin">Gen. 2.17.</note> forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit may not be taſted; and when God hath ſet us limits,<note place="margin">Exod. 19.12.</note> we may not paſſe our bounds, leaſt we die; Being creatures we muſt ſubmit our ſelves to our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: and if we will be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, faith muſt ſatisfie where reaſon cannot. And good reaſon there is it ſhould be ſo, both for our humiliation and trial. To <hi>humble</hi> us when we ſhall ſee our reaſon non-pluſt, even in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of greateſt conſequence, and to <hi>try</hi> our faith in mounting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove reaſon, when it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that wee rely more upon Gods word then our own fancy. Now that the ſoule is immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and that all men are ſtained with originall ſinne: are things moſt certaine, for the Scripture plainly affirmes them: And if the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96743:10"/>originall of the ſoule be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, yet even reaſon teacheth, that it is altogether madneſſe to reject a certaine truth for uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. Juſtly therefore is their curioſity to be condemned, who are wondrous inquiſitive to know whence the ſoule came, but care not at all whither it goes. Indeed deſiring to ſee cauſe of doubting in the one, that they may have the more libertie to be careleſſe in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Cautions to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</note>Yet is not this ſo to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as if we were not to ſeeke after any thing, but that which is manifeſt in the Scripture, for ſo we ſhall not need to ſeeke at all. Neither is every queſtion cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, which may ſeem to be ſo: but that indeed is a curious que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, which is either needleſſe, or not revealed. Nor how need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full this preſent queſtion about the ſoules originall is, no man doubteth, the onely <hi>quaere</hi> is,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96743:10"/>whither it be revealed or no; and indeed many thinke it is not. But beſides that all things are not revealed at once; we muſt know that God reveales things two wayes: either by his word, or by his works. Now as many things are not to be found in the booke of the creatures, are yet manifeſt in the booke of the Scriptures. So many things that are not mentioned in the word, are yet manifeſt in the works of God. It is our dutie therefore to ſearch both. But divine things are to be ſought eſpecially in the former, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall (as this is) in the latter, yet ſtill comparing both together. If therefore this truth can be found in either, then it is revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: neither can we ſay, it is a ſecret, untill both be throughly ſearched. And becauſe there is a depth in both paſt finding out, therefore we muſt exerciſe our ſelves in them day and night;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96743:11"/>and never leave ſearching, I meane for things needfull, ſo long as the world endureth, and in this cauſe where God is ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in revealing, it is to make us the more diligent in ſearching and enquiring.</p>
               <p>For as Curioſitie on the one hand, ſo negligence on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is alſo to be avoided. And not onely in regard of thoſe fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall doctrines which doe ſo neerly depend upon it, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowing of which would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturne all Religion, but alſo in regard of the godly them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, both to ſtay their minds in this wavering age, and to cut off thoſe doubts and unbeſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing motions, which through Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans malice, and our owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, are too apt to ariſe even in the hearts of Gods beſt chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and laſtly, to ſtop the mouths of wicked men and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts, who are ready upon all occaſions to blaſpheme GOD,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96743:11"/>and make a mocke of Religion. For the ſhunning of ſuch diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties as theſe; under a colour of modeſty, and to avoid curioſity, or the like, gives them occaſion of ſuſpition, that there is ſome ſecret fraud which we are afraid to diſcover, in all points of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie therefore ſo much as is mani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I certainly beleeve, though reaſon ſeemes againſt it, and withall I know that it is not for me to queſtion the doctrine, but to blame mine owne ignorance, and ſo ſet my ſelfe to ſearch, not becauſe I doubt, but becauſe I doe beleeve the truth. And this we may and muſt performe as well for our owne ſatisfaction, as the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others.</p>
               <p>Neither may the difficulty diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us, but rather whet on our diligence ſo much the more: wherin for our comfort, ſo long as we maintaine that the ſoule is ſo produced (whither immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96743:12"/>from God, or mediately from man) that it is of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall nature, and yet ſtained with originall ſin, according to the Scriptures: what ever we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of the manner, we are out of danger of hereſie, though perhaps ſubject to error. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet may the feare of being cenſured for preſumption or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie, hinder the ſober ſearch of it; which though it cannot juſtly for the former reaſons, yet can hardly be avoided: not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe ſome lazy perſons would gladly free themſelves of that labour, by calling it curious, but alſo conſidering the intricate niceneſſe of it, which is ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as may ſeeme to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led curiouſly, and yet without curioſitie; yea, curiouſneſſe it ſelfe is no curioſitie in ſuch a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious (though neceſſary) queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Wherefore taking Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy on the one hand, and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie on the other hand, to leade

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96743:15"/>Whence it is that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of other creatures are much more perfectly in man, and chiefly in the ſoule of man. And thoſe vertues which are in mens ſoules, are after a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent manner in Angels: and all perfection moſt perfectly of all in God. Now as their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are, ſo alſo are their facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and therefore in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the knowledge of inferiour natures, is comprehended by the ſuperiour, but never the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our by the inferiour; I meane properly and naturally. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſoule knowes by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſpirituall Ideas, or abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ſpecies, which being groſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken from the ſenſes, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by degrees, as they come neerer the ſoule: hence it is that the knowledg of things (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the manner of out know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) is a more intellectuall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of them; and ſo of an higher nature than the things

               <p>If it be ſaid, if the ſoule be thus ignorant of it ſelfe, how then doe men know Angels, &amp; both men and Angels God, being ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior natures?</p>

               <p>Secondly, I anſwer the ſoule knoweth Angels,<note place="margin">2. Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> and both men and Angels, &amp; God two wayes: Firſt, by the <hi>inferiour;</hi> ſecondly, by the <hi>ſuperiour</hi> it ſelfe. By the inferiour: ſo by conſequents

                  <note place="margin">Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Scripture.</note>And firſt to anſwer thoſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of Scripture, which are brought to prove the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate creation of the ſoule; that generall anſwer of that divine Father Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> may ſerve for all, <hi>i. e.</hi> that the divine teſtimonies only teach that God is the giver and former of our ſoules; but they doe not declare how or by what meanes, God ſendeth them into us.

As for example (to take them up in order) the firſt is drawne by conſequence from a Law which God made concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the hurting of a woman with childe: for which if it were ſo that her fruit did depart from her before it was informed with a ſoule (as they would have it) then he ſhould have ſome light puniſhment onely; but if it were informed with a ſoule, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by periſh; then he that did it ſhould dye the death.

But firſt of all,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> this is to corrupt the Text, for the words truely tranſlated be theſe: If men ſtrive and hurt a woman with childe, ſo that her fruit depart from her, and yet no miſchiefe follow, or (as ſome reade it) death follow not,<note place="margin">Geneva Bible.</note> (for ſo it is in the Originall) he ſhall he ſurely puniſhed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the womans husband will lay upon him, &amp;c. and if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miſchiefe or death followeth then thou ſhalt give life for life, &amp;c.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96743:38"/>of quickning, elſe no judgement could be given, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none can know when the ſoule is infuſed: &amp; if that ſhould be the meaning, ſeeing they ſay the rationall ſoule comes after vegetation and ſenſe, it muſt be needs that the childe can move before it hath a rationall ſoule, and ſo it ſhall ſtill be uncertaine when a man ſhall deſerve death by ſuch a miſchance, unleſſe we could ſet downe the juſt time when God did infuſe the ſoule, or feele when it is infuſed. But touching the quickning, there is more reaſon a man ſhould dye for it after then before, though the ſoule be the ſame from the beginning, both becauſe it is not ſo certaine before what it is, or whether it be any thing or no: and alſo before it be come to that perfection, any light matter might occaſion a miſchance, for which there were no reaſon a man ſhould looſe his life.</p>

Laſtly,<note place="margin">3.</note> this is to be underſtood of the mother, as well as of the childe.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:96743:44"/>the word, ſo the Antitheſis makes it apparant that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in this place makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a twofold caſtigation, the one carnall, the other ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: ſo that not ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? but ſpirituall and carnall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation is here oppoſed. But be it that God is here in a peculiar right called the Father of ſoules, it muſt not be in a ſenſe of our own deviſing, whereof there is no example nor warrant in the Scripture, but as they teach us: which is that he created mans ſoule after a peculiar manner; not of former matter, as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and all other creatures, but immediately of nothing, when he breathed into him the breath of life. Laſtly, I grant that God hath a more peculiar worke in the production of every mans ſoule, than in any other thing throughout the whole order of nature, and yet according to the courſe of nature too.

And
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96743:45"/>ſeeing our Saviour Chriſt ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Manage, calleth men back to the firſt inſtitution, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>it was not ſo from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;</hi> there is the ſame reaſon why we ſhould learne the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of our ſoules alſo from the beginning. But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, there is no more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, nor indeed probability that our ſoules ſhould be created of nothing, becauſe his was: then that our bodyes ſhould be ſtill made of the ſlime of the earth, becauſe his was. For every one knoweth there is one conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the firſt creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or things, and another in the producing of them afterwards, according to their kindes by ordinary gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And if this difference ſhould alter the kinde, then it ſhould doe ſo in all other living creatures as well; for though in part they were made of that firſt matter, yet were they in part alſo created by the immediate
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96743:45"/>power of God; as well as <hi>Adam.</hi> But ſeeing it cannot vary the kind in them, it cannot by the courſe of nature doe ſo in us nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Nay, it ſeemes in the text there is more reaſon, it ſhould be thus for man rather than for any other creature. For it is ſaid, <hi>God breathed into his noſtrils the breath of lives:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 2.7.</note> the plurality of which word may in reaſon be better expounded of the many lives that were potentially in him, than of the divers faculties and operations which yet are but one life: and proceed from one ſoule onely. And the rather becauſe the words <hi>Spiraculum vitarum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> might well be rendred the Spirit of Soules. As who ſhould ſay that ſpirituall nature which was the fountaine of all thoſe ſoules which have beene produced ever ſince; and (which is to be noted) this is never affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of any creature in Scripture but ſuch as being made male and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:96743:46"/>female, had power given them to propagate more of the ſame kinde;<note place="margin">Gen. 7 15. &amp; 6.17.</note> ſo that it may ſeeme to be principally ſpoken for this cauſe, and therefore to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to man above all the reſt, and chiefly in reſpect of the ſoule, which being made after ſuch an immediate manner in man, is therefore of a farre dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and more excellent nature than the ſoules of bruites, but yet propagated as well as they.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">From the creation of <hi>Eves</hi> ſoule.</note>A ſecond reaſon is drawne forcibly from the creation of <hi>Eve,</hi> for becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the difference that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the creation of her body and his; the one being made of the duſt, the other of a rib: but ſpeaketh not of aw difference in the creation of their ſoules: therefore (ſay ſome) it is very probable that both were created alike of nothing; otherwiſe <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> would never have omitted it, eſpecially conſidering it was his
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:96743:46"/>principall intent to declare the originall of all things.</p>
               <p>But this alſo is eaſily anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> For, firſt, if it be a good argument that <hi>Moſes</hi> would not have omitted it, if it had beene otherwiſe created than <hi>Adams</hi> was; then it is much more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to prove that ſhee had no ſoule at all. For if that which was taken out of <hi>Adam</hi> made the body onely, then it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed he ſpeakes nothing of the creation of her ſoule, but leaves us to gueſſe that it might be as <hi>Adams</hi> was; or rather that ſhee had none at all, otherwiſe <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> would never have omitted it. Secondly, it is the thing in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether <hi>Moſes</hi> expreſſeth the different creation of their bodyes onely, and not of their whole perſons rather, according to the expreſſe words in the text. Thirdly, if it ſhould be granted that her ſoule was immediately created of nothing, it were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:96743:47"/>to the purpoſe: for this is ſtill in the friſt creation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, and therefore no fit rule to meaſure the manner of mans propagation afterward. Laſtly, it is at leaſt to prove one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne thing by another, there being no leſſe doubt of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the creation of her ſoule than of ours. But for my part ſeeing in things doubtfull that which hath moſt reaſon, is to be received as moſt reaſonable: I ſhould rather thinke her whole perſon both ſoule and body, to have beene made of <hi>Adams</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance than otherwiſe, and that for theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of any more immediate creation of Soules, but of the firſt; He ſaith not, that God breathed into her noſtrils the breath of lives as into <hi>Adams:</hi> there is not the leaſt word or ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle that can ſeeme to ſignifie any ſuch matter, and what reaſon
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:96743:47"/>can be given that he who omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not the circumſtance of the manner of cloſing up <hi>Adams</hi> ſide againe, ſhould overſlip that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous worke of God in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting another new ſoule, if he had done ſo. Neither is it ſufficient to ſay, it was in vaine to repeate it, for it is no where affirmed; and if it were not needfull, why ſhould it ſtill be doubtfull, and men left onely to gueſſe at it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Not only doth <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> not ſpeake of any new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſoule infuſed into her, but if only her body was made of that which was taken from <hi>Adam,</hi> (as is ſaid) then for ought <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſpeakes of it, it may be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned whither ſhee had any ſoule or no; which muſt needs be very abſurd eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96743:48"/>of God. Thirdly, ſo far is <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> from teaching that, that he plainly affirmes the contrary; ſaying, that of that rib, he made a woman; not a body, ſpeaking of her whole perſon, and not of a part onely; unleſſe a woman may be a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without a ſoule, as ſome ſilly ones have fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagined.</p>

Gen. 2.23.</note> thoſe that hold the contrary opinion, yet graunt that God did not onely take out the bare bone only out of <hi>Adams</hi> ſide, but ſome fleſh together with it; which made <hi>Adam</hi> to ſay, this is not onely bone of my bone, but fleſh of my fleſh. And it ſeemeth an unlikely thing, that being done inſtantly by the almighty power of GOD, he ſhould take out a dry and dead bone onely; and not the life, ſpirit, &amp; ſoule, that was in it, (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of the ſoules be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch a ſubſtance) together with it Now it he tooke it thus
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:96743:48"/>whole together as it was, (the ſoule not being ſhut out of any part of the body;) how eaſie is it to conceive, how God might miraculouſly, in the firſt creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeperate the whole matter of her perſon from <hi>Adam</hi> onely, and ſo of that bone as of a living body, produce a new creature in a ſhort time; which now in lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time uſc to be ſeperated from both ſexes, and ſo perfected by degrees in naturall generation: yea, why may not this originall affinitie between the two ſexes, give ſtrength to the courſe of nature in producing more, by uniting them againe in genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, This is the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, becauſe herein we have a clear type of Chriſts incarnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whoſe whole humanity, (as we ſhall herafter ſee) was alſo mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly made of the ſubſtance of the virgin onely, as <hi>Eves</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Adam;</hi> a man of a woman

                  </gap> when it was done.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, when ſhe was brought to <hi>Adam,</hi> he confeſſed that <hi>ſhee was bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh,</hi> that is, of the ſame humane nature that he himſelfe was both for ſoule and body, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo taken out or him. Neither needed he to ſay, ſoule or my ſoule; for fleſh is uſually put for the whole perſon; as where (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the ſame book) it is ſaid, <hi>All fleſh had corrupted their wayes:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 6.12.</note> which notwithſtanding is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in regard of the ſoule. And leaſt any ſhould doubt of it, he preſently addes. <hi>Shee ſhall he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lea woman, becauſe ſhee was taken out of man:</hi> where he plainly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes, that her whole perſon was taken out of man, and for that cauſe was named woman, which cannot poſſibly be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the body onely. I will
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:96743:49"/>therefore hereunto ſubjoyne the forgoing words of our Saviour; <hi>Let no man ſeperate what God hath joyned together,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 19.6.</note> and conclude that her whole perſon, as well ſoule as body was taken out of man. So that in this alſo, that of the Apoſtle is true, <hi>God hath made all of one blood,</hi> even <hi>Adams.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 17.26.</note> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from this reaſon I alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the contrary, that ſeeing in all probabilities <hi>Adams</hi> ſoule was of ſuch a nature, as thereon could be made another, and ours are of the ſame nature that his was: it is not abſurd? but very likely, that others may be made of ours alſo.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt reaſon of any weight is,<note place="margin">3.</note> that Chriſts ſoule was created of nothing, and he is like unto us in all things, ſinne onely excepted (<hi>ergo,</hi> &amp;c.) But firſt if it be neceſſary,<note place="margin">1. From the creation of Chriſts ſoule.</note> that wee ſhould be like unto him in all things except ſin, then it would follow that we ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96743:50"/>by the Holy Ghoſt, as he was, for that was without ſinne; eſpecially, if he might have been conceived without ſin, without that worke, as by this doctrine it ſeemes he might, as afterward wee ſhall ſee.<note place="margin">2.</note> Secondly, it is not yet proved that Chriſts ſoule was immediately created of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; yea, it may be denied by the ſame reaſon, for then wee ſhould not be alike to him in all things except ſin. If it be ſaid that if Chriſts ſoule had beene traduced by ordinary generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it muſt needs have beene ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, I graunt it; and therefore, I ſay, it was that his conception was extraordinary and ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall; for it being impoſſible in nature for a Virgin to conceive without man, therefore this was brought to paſſe by the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous power of the Holy Ghoſt, who ſeperated a part of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin for that purpoſe, and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what was wanting in nature
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:96743:50"/>by ſupernaturall power, which is ſignified in that it is ſaid, <hi>Shee was overſhadowed by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> But although he was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived after the manner that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men are, that ſo he might be without ſinne: yet it followeth not from hence, but his whole humanitie, both ſoule and body might be made of the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that other mens are, ſo as he be not corrupted with ſinne. Which how it may be, we ſhall heare in the proper place, where this alſo ſhall be brought as an Argument to prove the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: ſo weake are objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Though it ſhould be granted that Chriſts ſoule was immediately created by God, as the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> was; becauſe it could not be propagated after the manner of mankinde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne, yet it would not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that all ours are therefore ſo, as they collect. Nay, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96743:51"/>plainly appeareth; for, for the ſame cauſe that his muſt be created immediately to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne, ours muſt be mediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they may be ſinfull; and tor the ſame cauſe he cannot be propagated without ſinne, we cannot be ſinfull unleſſe propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and reaſons drawne from them, to prove the immediate creation of ſoules. Whereby all men may ſee upon what weake grounds, this opinion is father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon the Scriptures. And now I am to encounter with the other troope of Arguments tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from the impoſſibilitie of the ſoules propagation.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, though ſoules are of a ſimple ſpirituall ſubſtance, as are Angels in reſpect of elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary; yet even Angels themſelves and much more mens ſoules, are not without a ſpirituall kinde of compoſition. For to be ſimply ſimple, is proper onely to the nature of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Mens ſoules are of a farre more inferiour nature,

               <p>Laſtly, We ſee it is the will of God, that ſoules ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced with bodyes, one after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in a naturall order to the worlds end, and therefore hath conferred his efficient power for the effecting thereof from the beginning; none of all which can be affirmed of Angels. And now let reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or any reaſonable man judge, whether it will follow, that becauſe one Angell neither doth nor can beget another, therfore man cannot beget man; yea, God cannot by man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one ſoule out of another, though after a metaphyſicall manner, as for the reaſons afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid we cannot throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>

                  <note place="margin">3. The ſoule is imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall.</note>Of the ſame kinde is that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that the ſoule is imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall, and the reaſon ſtands thus: Whatſoever is made, muſt be either of nothing, or of ſome matter pre-exiſting: now the ſoule is without matter, and therfore cannot be propagated, but muſt needs be immediately created of nothing. But I deny the ſoule is altogether immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall; for although it hath no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementary matter, yet it hath ſpirituall matter: For all created ſpirits, being compounded of act and potency, have a kinde of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude with corporall natures, both in regard of matter and forme; yea, even Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But by a kinde of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendency, their matter is as our forme, and their forme as the forme of our forme: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we want fitter words, may indifferently be called ſpirituall matter and forme, which doe beſt of all agree with the inferior
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:96743:54"/>nature of the ſoule: And if it be ſaid,<note place="margin">The ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſoule.</note> it can have no ſuch ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all all matter. becauſe then it muſt be of ſuch a nature as may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive contrary formes, as we ſee in the generation of all other creatures, by reaſon whereof the ſoule ſhall be made corruptible I anſwer, firſt, that though it be ſo in elementary generations, yet it followeth not in ſpirituall compoſitions, ſeeing their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is of an higher kind. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Though nature cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one ſoule put of another, but by a corruptible courſe, yet it followeth not but the God of nature may. Thirdly, as the ſoule to ſpeake properly, conſiſts ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of power than any parts: ſo the propagation is rather by promotion then than any deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Fourthly as the ſoule hath its eſſence more in the power and faculty, than in the matter of it: ſo more is to be aſcribed to the efficient, than to the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:96743:54"/>cauſe, more to God than to man, and yet that according to the courſe of nature too. Laſtly, as man is the perfection of the creatures, ſo his is the perfection of generation. It is no ſtrange thing therefore, but very fitting that there ſhould be ſomewhat in it tranſcending the common courſe, as namely, that one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall nature ſhould be derived from another, by ſuch a kind of generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as is very neere a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by vertue of that firſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and continual aſſiſtance of the father of ſpirits, on whom the ſoule hath ſo neere a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4. The ſoule corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note>Againe, it is objected that the ſoule is incorruptible. and it is a rule in nature, <hi>Generatio unius eſt corruptio alterius;</hi> the generation of one is the corruption of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now if in every generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there muſt be a corruption, ſeeing the ſoule cannot be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, it cannot be generated
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:96743:55"/>neither. But, firſt, if this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be graunted in the generation of the ſoule, it is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>termino a quo,</hi> which cannot hinder the immortalitie of the ſoule that is propagated, neither doth it belong to the ſoule that doth propagate, for the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is of the ſoule generated, not of the ſoule generating. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, what manner of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is that which is here meant? A periſhing indeed, but ſuch an one is rather a perfecting. For in generation the ſeed is not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by putrefaction, but by perfection; that is, it ceaſeth to be that which before it was, and is made that which it was not; becauſe the potentiall being is turned into actuall being; ſeed into a creature: ſo that the thing is the ſame that it was before, though not after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that before it was: and thus I graunt there is a corruption in the ſoules generation, namely, it
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:96743:55"/>ceaſeth to be in power onely when it is in act: and why then there is not ſomething in man that is not the ſoule, but rather the ſeminary of the ſoule, as the ſeede is of the body, wee ſhall heare afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">5. It can ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt by it ſelfe.</note>Another argument is taken from the power that the ſoule hath to ſubſiſt by it ſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the body after this manner: if the ſoule cannot be produced without the body, then can it not live without the body: and if the bodies generation be the cauſe of producing it, the bodies corruption muſt alſo cauſe the death of it; but the ſoule can live without the body, and cannot be corrupted by it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not generated neither with nor by the body. Theſe things thus hudled up together, are partly true and partly falſe: for, firſt, there is not, nor ever was there a ſoul produced with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a body: that opinion of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:96743:56"/>was juſtly hiſſed out long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe: So that though no ſoule is produced by the body, yet no ſoule is produced without it. Secondly, it is not to be thought that any ſoule is produced by the body otherwiſe then by an aſſiſting cauſe, or <hi>cauſa ſine qua non;</hi> whether wee conſider the body generating or generated: but this, I ſay, that the ſoule is not brought forth without the ſeede of the parents, and yet not by that as it is corporall onely, but as there is ſoule-ſeede, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpirituall power in it: And thus the ſoule ſhall be no leſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſubſiſt by it ſelfe, although it be not propagated without the body, then a childe ſhall not be able to live after the death of his parents, by whom it was brought forth into the world; and as it is not generated, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be corrupted by the body. Laſtly, it cannot be ſaid properly that the ſoule doth
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:96743:56"/>ſubſiſt by it ſelfe alone, ſo long as it is united to the body, for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the courſe of nature it cannot doe ſo; but after the death of the body, for as much as it is not made of mortall ſeede nor produced meerely by the power of nature, and therefore cannot die: it cannot doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe but muſt but muſt of neceſſitie ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt by it ſelfe alone without the body.<note place="margin">6. It cannot be hurt by the body.</note> Of the ſame kinde is that objection, that as the body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not corrupt or hurt the ſoule, ſo much leſſe can the ſoule be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated by the body. For if it be abſurd to ſay the ſoule is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with ſin by the body, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that which is corporeall cannot worke upon that which is incorporeall) much more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd is it that the ſoule ſhould be generated by the body. But this alſo falleth beſide without hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, for though the ſoule can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be generated of or by the body (which I alſo confidently
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:96743:57"/>affirme) yet this is no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment why it cannot be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out of the ſoule by the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent power of God, to which the Body alſo may be an inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall cauſe in this as well as it is in all other ordinary actions of the ſoule.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">7. It worketh in-organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally.</note>Laſtly, it is objected that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proper actions of the ſoule (as to underſtand and will) are performed without any help of the body: ſo alſo is the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall being of it; for ſuch as the operation of any thing is, ſuch is the eſſence, and contrarily, as Philoſophy teacheth. But firſt it may be doubted whether any action of the ſoule be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med without any helpe at all from the body ſo long as the union laſteth. Secondly, for as much as the ſoule ordinarily doth neither underſtand nor will, without the aſſiſtance of the animall ſpirits, it followes (according to the former rule)
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:96743:57"/>that by the courſe of nature nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the originall without ſome operation of the body. And whereas it is ſaid, the mind it ſelfe muſt be free from all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that it may be the better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſcerne the ſame; as the eye judgeth of colours: this may proceed not ſo much from the vacuity of matter, as the equall reſpect it hath to all matter. For being the perfection of this mundane frame, it hath the Idea of all natures in it, as the eye doth repreſent all colours. But as the agent is more noble than the patient, though proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to it, ſo is the ſoule above all matter, and yet agreeing with it. Anſwerable whereunto the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall (according to the former rule) muſt needs be more tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent than the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon courſe of generation. Laſtly, all thoſe arguments are more forcible to prove that the ſoule cannot be united with the body: and being
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:96743:58"/>manifeſtly falſe in that, they have ſmall probabilitie of truth in this.</p>

And as in that elementary inflammation the Lamp is not turned into the flame, but inflamed by another; ſo the corporall ſeede is not tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into the ſoule, but informed with a ſoule by others.

For firſt, why might wee not for the ſame cauſe ſay, that there muſt be two bodyes alſo, one from the father and another from the mother? and if it be ſaid that one partakes of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:96743:62"/>both, how comes it to paſſe then, that it is ſometimes like the father onely, &amp; ſometimes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly like the mother; yea, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a ſon like the mother and a daughter like the father. In all other things moſt contrary to that part from whence the ſex is received. And if it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that the worke of nature herein is above reaſon, what wonder if it be ſo in the ſoule alſo; yea, why ſhould it not be ſo in that, much rather than in this? and if the former draw us onely to an admiration, but not to a negation of if, becauſe the thing is apparent: why ſhould not the latter doe ſo alſo, ſeeing in nature it is no leſſe manifeſt then the former, both being brought forth together as wee ſee? To come a little neerer the matter,<note place="margin">One crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made of two ſouls.</note> I would firſt of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand how it commeth to paſſe, that among all living creatures of two divers ſeeds, that is to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:96743:63"/>ſay, of the male and female is notwithſtanding generated but one creature of the one kinde? Since as Philoſophers truely teach, the ſpecies of things can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be mingled no more than ſoules:<note place="margin">

                  </note> and the eſſence of every thing is indiviſible; and two formes cannot be made one. Now ſeeing the ſeede of any creature conteines in it both matter and forme thereof: and is the ſame in <hi>potentiâ</hi> (as they ſpeake) differing from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe onely ſo much as power differeth from act; that is, ability to be or doe, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or being done; how there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can it poſſibly be that one creature can be produced from two ſeedes in univocall genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſeeing alſo that vegetative nature have therefore but one ſeede. Theſe reaſons made <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> deny that females had any ſeede at all, being onely as the ground wherein ſeede is ſowen.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:96743:63"/>Now if this be true, the point is cleare without any farther ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; for then the ſoule procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the ſoule of the father onely, there ſhall not need be two ſoules, nor one mingled of two.<note place="margin">How the ſoule is from both as both are one.</note> But this is denied, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome further anſwer is to be ſought out. For though the ſex proceed not from the ſex, yet (they ſay) if this were true, neither by the courſe of nature could ever be propagation by both. Be it ſo, yet I ſay, that as two ſeeds produce but one crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe the ſeeds of male and female, though they be two in number are but one kind (elſe there muſt be two bodyes alſo) ſo it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the ſoule more plainly, I ſay,<note place="margin">The ſeede of both but one ſeede.</note> that as the ſeede of either apart cannot properly be called ſeed-ſeed, becauſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them alone conteines the matter and forme of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and is not <hi>Animal in poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiâ;</hi> but at the inſtant of concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96743:64"/>when both ſeedes are ſo mingled that therein is contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the power of producing the like, then onely it is rightly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſeede; and before, onely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may be thus; for that is to be actually ſeede to have this potency in it: ſo as the ſeede is properly but one in all ſenſitive creatures aſwell as in vegetative, in that ſenſe that theirs is: ſo in like manner, I ſay, that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſeede of the ſoule (if by way of reſemblance I may ſo call it) is not in the ſeverall ſeede of either ſex (for there is no ſuch materiall or locall diviſion) but rather in both when but one. For in generation wee may not conceive one act to be made of two; but two in act doe make one. The myſtery of which u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion lyes in this, that the nature is one, and the ſexes two, which againe united in one produce a third.</p>

For the anſwering of this objection, it muſt be conſidered that the ſubſtance &amp; matter of the ſoule is not like theſe corporall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and ſo though this would follow in thoſe, yet not in that. It is commonly ſaid of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers (to which Divines alſo conſent) that the ſoule is <hi>tota in toto, &amp; tota in qualibet parte;</hi> wholly in the whole body, and wholly in every part. So that the ſoule cannot be divided into parts; but if we will needs conſider of a part, that part is the whole and yet the whole not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:96743:66"/>and therefore when one ſoule is propagated of another, it is all one whether we ſay it be of the whole, or of a part: for even that part is the whole, and yet (according to the received doctrine) the whole not divided, nor any whit diminiſhed.</p>

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:96743:67"/>is not united to the body by tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, therefore alſo it is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded within the bounds of the body (as water is in a veſſell) and becauſe it is not ſo included within the bounds of the body, therefore alſo it is not ſtretched out to the utmoſt limits of the body; and conſequently it is a vaine quaere, whether the whole ſoule be in the whole body, or whole in every part. Now if this indeed be the truth (as indeed it commeth neerer to the pure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſoule) it is no whit leſſe to the preſent purpoſe; ſeeing it followeth accordingly, that the ſoule is in the ſeede, and yet not conteined of it: and ſo the propagatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereof is rather a powerfull operation, than any locall diviſion. For ſeeing all confeſſe that the eſſence of the ſoule, properly conſidered, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not in parts, but in powers; it muſt needs be confeſſed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that proportionably there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:96743:67"/>that the propagation of the ſoule is not by deciſion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by one part is ſeperated from another; but by promotion, whereby the ſame power is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in another, which it hath in it ſelfe; and this is the manner of propagation, which (as I ſaid) is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>venient to the nature of the ſoule. The rather is this to be received as agreeable to nature and reaſon, becauſe if it be well obſerved, we ſhall finde that the very nature and eſſence of ſoules conſiſt chiefly in their faculties: as corporall natures in their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary compoſition: and God himſelfe in vertues: his nature, being, as well as being moſt knowne, in goodneſſe, juſtice, mercy, &amp;c. which perfections as they are too high to be eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to any created nature: ſo are they all that one eſſentiall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which is in God, or rather which is God himſelfe. Now ſeeing the ſoules nature conſiſts
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:96743:68"/>eſpecially in the divine faculty of it, this doctrine may beſt be cleared by conſidering the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof. Whereby it may appear, even as when I give ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my underſtanding, or make him know that which I know, my knowledge is ſtill the ſame, and nothing diminiſhed: ſo when theſe intellectuall natures, I meane one ſoule produceth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, the ſoule is ſtill the ſame and indiviſible. I know to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the notion is one thing &amp; the faculty another: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding herein the ſimilitude holdeth, that even as the notion communicated to another, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe perfect in his minde that imparts it: ſo even the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty it ſelfe (which in reſpect of corporall natures is as a reall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) when it is propagated to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, is nevertheleſſe perfect in him from whom it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>

That the ſoule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note>Secondly, I anſwer, that though it ſhould be granted, that the more groſſe and corporall parts of the ſeede doe (as indeed they do) require time before they can be throughly mixed &amp; knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to make a perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception: yet in reaſon it muſt needs be, that the more ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all parts, and chiefly the ſoule is conceived in the firſt inſtant; I meane a ſmall moment of time, and that in the beginning at the firſt meeting and union of the ſeeds of both ſexes. And thus it
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:96743:71"/>muſt needs be, not only becauſe ſpirituall natures are more quick and ſubtill, and ſo move in leſſe time than corporall; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may doe that in a moment, which the other cannot doe but in a longer time; whence it is that in eating and drinking wee ſee the ſpirits are refreſhed, and the man ſtrengthened immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after he hath eaten, before ever the meat can be concocted; but alſo experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce teacheth, that in the breeding of all creatures, the internall parts are perfect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the externall, the more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall parts of the body, before thoſe that are more groſſe and corporall; and therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth by like reaſon that the ſpirits in man have their perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction before the body, and the ſoule before the ſpirits: for there is no doubt but nature obſerves the ſame order in the beginning that ſhe doth in the continuance of her worke, there being one

               <p>And hence it is that if all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes doe not fitly concurre toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the forming the ſeede with the ſoule at firſt, by whoſe working it may proceed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection afterward, the whole worke is fruſtrated.</p>

The conſideration whereof may teach us, what the reaſon in nature ſhould be, that there is more failing in the conception of man than of other creatures.

Now this very beginning only is properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, all that followeth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward being nothing but a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued perfecting of this begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by inſenſible degrees: which not nature but reaſon, hath diſtinguiſhed into concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, forming, quickning, &amp;c. to every of which that time is allotted, wherein that worke moſt appeares, though natures work be one and the ſame from the beginning.</p>

Whether the ſoule be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect at firſt.</note>But here it will he objected, that if the ſoule be in the ſeede at the firſt conception, it muſt needs be very weake and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect at the firſt, and ſo growing and increaſing with the body, it muſt alſo decreaſe and dye with it.</p>
               <p>For anſwer whereunto, I would firſt of all demand of them who hold that it comes by immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate creation, how the ſoule of an infant newly quickened in the mothers wombe, can be as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as when it is a perfect man? Surely there is not ſo much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference (at leaſt in tho ſoules ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance) betweene conception and quickening, as is betweene quickning and manhood: when therefore they anſwer the one, I may happily thereby alſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the other. But not to ſtay ſo long, in the ſecond place I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that all ſoules as well the ſoules of beaſts as of men, are eſſentially as perfect in the firſt

For reaſon teacheth that that which is firſt, and gives perfection to all the reſt, cannot have another before it to give perfection to that; for ſo there ſhould be a firſt before the firſt: and a ſoule of the ſoule. And ſeeing the ſoule is the eſſentiall forme, it muſt needs be unchangeable alſo: for it is impoſſible the forme ſhould
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:96743:74"/>be altered, ſo long as the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture continues the ſame, what creature ſoever it be. So that this never change but at death, nor then neither in men: becauſe it is begotten of immortall ſeede, and not brought forth without the immediate hand of GOD. It skilleth not therfore whether the ſoule can ſee, heare, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when it is in the ſeede: it ſufficeth that it hath that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and divine nature, which when the organs are perfected, is able to doe it. Herein it is with the ſoule as with the body; the child newly conceived hath not the faſhion of an humane body; yet is there all that is eſſentiall to the nature of it, as will in time appeare; ſo is there all that is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall to the ſoule in concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but the bodily parts requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring time hath it imperfectly, the ſoule being ſpirituall and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove time, hath it perfectly in the firſt inſtant: yet in this caſe

Of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Twinnes.</note>Laſtly, concerning the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuperfetation, whether twins be conceived at once or at divers times; we need not much to diſpute. For whether it be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or both wayes, it makes no matter; for if nature hath power to worke ſo diverſly for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of bodies, there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but that both God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is able to indue them with ſoules accordingly. And it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the point in hand, that howſoever the manner of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration be, there is (at leaſt of the ſoule whereof we diſpute) but one conception of one, and that at once, which once is in propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:96743:75"/>For though among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures, the receiving of the ſeede once, ſometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth many, and often, many times but one; yet we need not grant it ſo in humane propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and yet if we ſhould in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the former we need not doubt (as I ſaid) but God is as powerfull to produce ſoules, as nature is to bring forth bodies: and for the other, we muſt needs thinke, either that the former is a propagation to the latter, or elſe the latter a perfecting of the former (otherwiſe there would be divers bodyes too, any or all of which rightly underſtood, may well ſtand with this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the ſoules propagation: yet in all probability there is but one for one with us; howſoever there are many for one; and one for many in ſome other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

For ſeeing God hath a two-fold voyce, the one ſpeaking in the Booke of the Scriptures, and the other in the Booke of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; when the divine Oracles of the former cannot be heard, we muſt give eare to naturall reaſons drawne out of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: the voyce of natures agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Scriptures, being indeed the voyce of God. The proofes from the Scripture, ſhall be of two ſorts likewiſe, either direct teſtimonies, or reaſons drawne from them. And againe
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:96743:76"/>the teſtimonies ſhalbe firſt from the old, and then from the new Teſtament, which we will take up in order as wee ſhall meet with them.</p>
               <p>And firſt that this doctrine may not ſeeme new, I will prove it even from the beginning of the world, beginning firſt with the teſtimony of God himſelfe, who in the day he created man upon the face of the earth; he created them male and female, and bleſſed them, and ſaid unto them;<note place="margin">1.

                  </gap> to ſubdue it alſo,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.27, 28.</note> which muſt certainly be underſtood of the whole man, and not of the body onely. For what is the body that it ſhould ſubdue the earth, or who is man that he ſhould limit the holy. One of Iſrael? or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ſet bounds where God hath ſet none? Neither can there
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:96743:77"/>be any colour of doubt how this is to be underſtood, ſeeing God ſpake the very ſame immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before,<note place="margin">Verſe 22.</note> even to the fiſhes and fowles. For, ſaith the Text, <hi>God bleſſed them, ſaying, be fruitfull and multiply, and fill the waters, &amp;c.</hi> As therefore God ſo framed their natures, and gave ſuch power unto them, that the like might produce the like unto it ſelfe, as touching the whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: ſo if we will beleeve God and his word, man doth produce man the whole, the whole as well as other creatures. Beſides, how can it ſtand with reaſon, that that bleſſing that proves ſufficiently effectuall to the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt creatures, ſhould not only be effectual in man the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent? eſpecially ſo groſſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, as that man ſhould not be able to propagate man, but ſome imperfect formeleſſe peice of a creature, which indeed is ſo unnaturall, as no man knowes
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:96743:77"/>what to call it. For the body of a man can be no more termed man, than the carcaſe of a bruite beaſt, can be called a bruit beaſt: and ſhall a beaſt, upon whom there is no ſuch bleſſing expreſly pronounced in Scripture, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to doe more this way in his kinde, than man who was moſt expreſly bleſſed, even twice over? yea, is it not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to reaſon, and religion too, that God ſhould command man that which he did not give him power to performe? for it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that God did not onely bleſſe, but command them, and it is no leſſe manifeſt, did extend to the whole man. Now if Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand reacheth to the whole man, and mans power reacheth onely to the body, or carcaſe; how can it be avoided but Gods command, ſhall be in vaine and unreaſonable, if not unjuſt? If in this worke the chiefe part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to God, it cannot with
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:96743:78"/>reaſon be aſcribed to man; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can God command him to doe all (according to his kinde, that is the law of nature) if he can doe but the leaſt part. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is to be conſidered that God ſo framed the nature of every li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creature, that it was apt, not onely for the bringing forth of the body, but alſo, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, of the ſoule, that being the chiefe part of the creature: ſo that this bleſſing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God doth principally reſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ct the ſoule in every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Whence it followeth that it is more abſurd to deny the propagation of the ſoule, than of the body; but moſt of all ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to deny it in man, who of all other creatures, is the moſt excellent, and herein moſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially bleſſed of God.</p>
               <p>To conclude therefore from the premiſes we may well frame this argument, that if the voyce &amp; ordinance of God, be no leſſe
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:96743:78"/>effectuall in man, then it is in the reſt of the living creatures propagating: then according to the ordinance of God, man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth whole man, ſoule and body. But the Antecedent is true, as appeares in the text, and therefore all ſo the conſequent.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting from his labour.</note>Secondly, It appeareth that God ſo ordered the nature of all creatures in the beginning, that they might perſiſt of themſelvs, and multiply their kinds by the power of nature; that ſo he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelte might not need to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes creating new creatures: and herein man was ranked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. And ſo on the ſeventh day (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi>) God ended the worke which he had made, and he reſted on the ſeventh day from all his-workes which he had made.</p>
               <p>How then dare we ſet him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke to create thouſands of new ſouls every day at our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.<note place="margin">Obj.</note>

               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:96743:79"/>
I know the ordinary anſwer is,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> that God indeed reſted from creating any more new kinds of things, but not from creating a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more individuals of the ſame kinde.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> But firſt there is no ſuch limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation extant there, nor in any other place of Scripture, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is to be rejected as a vaine imagination of mans braine.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This is a direct beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the queſtion; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> for they graunt it generally in all the workes of nature, yea, in every particular, excepting onely this exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their own: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaketh alike of both, aſcribing no more to one than to another.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, It is moſt abſurd to ſay, God reſted from creating more kinds: but not from crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting more particulars of the ſame kinde: becauſe to create new things of nothing is more properly a worke of creation,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:96743:79"/>than ſtill to produce new kinds out of former matter. For accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common definition of creation; <hi>Creatio eſt productio entis ex non ente,</hi> a making of ſomething of nothing. And therefore if God hath ſo ceaſed from his worke of creation, that he makes no more new kinds of creatures, although of former matter, much more hath he cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from creating daily new ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Laſtly, otherwiſe God ſhould not have ceaſed at all, for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, but there are new kinds co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually brought forth, and not onely in aequivocall ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, but by ſuch copulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as are out of kinde, whereby it commeth to paſſe, that there are divers kindes of creatures now in the world, which were not created by God in that ſort at the firſt: ſo that this reſting muſt be underſtood chiefly, if not onely, from immediately
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:96743:80"/>creating new ſubſtances of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. From this place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture therefore I reaſon thus: If God abſolutely ceaſed from the worke of Creation, then alſo he ceaſed from the creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſouls: but the Antecedent is true, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the conſequent.</p>

Neither can the force of this place be avoyded, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the ſoule is here by a Metonymy put for the body, or by a Synecdoche the whole ſoule put for the vegetable and ſenſible part of the ſoule; neither yet that it is only for that deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination is taken from the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part; or for that man diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the matter of the body for the receiving of the ſoule.

For the firſt, it is manifeſt they doe not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſpeake of their owne perſons
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:96743:85"/>onely, as being a matter proper to them alone, but in this they ranke themſelves with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, ſo as man here ſignifies all mankinde, male and female (as <hi>Moſes</hi> uſes the word) ſoule and body,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.27. &amp; 5.1.2.</note> and one as well as the other. When therefore they both expreſly affirme, that man is conceived in the wombe, it followeth that all men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens ſoules, have heir originall together with their bodyes. As for the terme <hi>ſecret place,</hi> it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the wombe of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where the childe is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which is expreſly named where he ſaith, <hi>thou haſt covered me in my mothers wombe:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>David</hi> ſaith, he <hi>was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfully formed in a ſecret place,</hi> he intimateth that the concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole man, is made in the wombe. Laſtly, the word <hi>maſſe,</hi> or <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth afterwards, makes it yet more manifeſt, for it ſignifieth
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:96743:85"/>all whatſoever is in man, which is alſo proved by the words that follow after: for he ſaith, that this whole maſſe or ſubſtance of man which is formed in the wombe, was deſcribed in the booke of Gods providence, and who dare deny but ſoule as well as the body was from all eternitie knowne unto the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God? for it is not meant of the members of the body only, but according to the true meaning of the words in the originally, all things whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in man, is brought forth in continuance of time, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was not. So that from theſe Scriptures I conclude thus; If whole man, with his whole maſſe or ſubſtance be conceived in the wombe of his mother, then his rationall ſoule, together with his body, is propagated out of or by vertue of the ſeede. But whole man together with his whole maſſe or ſubſtance, is
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:96743:86"/>conceived in the wombe of his mother; therefore the rationall ſoule, together with the body, is brought forth by vertue and power of the ſeede.</p>

And yet not meerely by the power of nature; for in the laſt place it is to be obſerved, that he ſaith, <hi>the Lord formeth it.</hi> For he indeed is the externall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, the nature of the ſoule being of that height, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an immediate act of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, it cannot be produced. Whence it is that in the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the ſoule, though it be not a creation, it is as neere to a creation as can be: and though it be by propagation, yet it is not meerly by propagation, but ſome way above it: and ſo it is in a manner a kinde of meane betweene creation and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

The neceſſitie alſo of our regeneration proves it; for if by our firſt birth we were not corrupt, then ſhould not the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond be neceſſary to ſalvation. Laſtly, the double grace which we receive from the ſecond <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, namely, Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication &amp; Regeneration, ſhews that there floweth a double evill from the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> namely the

It appeares by that which hath beene ſaid already, that all men are become ſinfull through <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, having loſt thoſe now ſupernaturall gifts, wherewith he and we with him were at firſt indued; and in ſtead therof, are all over infected with a venomous qualitie, or inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all manner of evill, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ignorance and blindneſſe in the minde, ſtubborneſſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in the will diſorder in the affections, making the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſenſuall and beaſt-like, all the members of the body inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of unrighteouſneſſe, and the whole man a ſlave to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill; and that from our firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even ſo farre as nature can

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Definitie Originalis peccati.</note>Originall ſin is the depravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole nature of man, conſiſting of the privation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall righteouſneſſe, and an inclination to all manner of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill; derived from <hi>Adam</hi> to all his poſteritie by naturall gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, whereby they ſtand guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of eternall death: in which definition, wee may ſee all the eſſentiall cauſes of originall ſin: the ſubject, or materiall cauſe, is the whole nature of man, all men, and every part of all men, ſoule, body, underſtanding, will, memory, affections, ſenſes, and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:96743:97"/>ſeverall members of the body, as they conſtitute the perſon of a man propagated from <hi>Adam.</hi> The formall cauſe is the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ſame, whereby e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man is deprived of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall righteouſneſſe, and prone to every ſin that can be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

               <p>More briefly, Originall ſinne is by ſome defined to be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation of mans nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of the privation of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and inclination to evill, contracted from the generation it ſelfe, and derived from <hi>Adam</hi> to all his poſteritie. For as ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is not onely a privation of health, but alſo an evill affection of the body, ariſing from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of the humours: ſo ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:96743:97"/>ſin is not onely the want of righteouſneſſe, but alſo an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinableneſſe to unrighteouſnes, ariſing from the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> and conveyed unto us by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall propagation.

It is a faculty, commonly accounted a ſpecies of the vegetative faculty, but is indeed the naturall perfection of a living creature, whether ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative, ſenſitive, or rationall; and it is the moſt excellent, and the moſt naturall faculty, being ingrafted into nature, with a ſpeciall charge &amp; bleſſing from God in the creation, and is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt deſired and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently moſt natural to all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that have life;<note place="margin">Gen. 1.22.28.</note> whereby like begets like; univocall which is moſt properly ſo called, when as a creature brings forth the like to it ſelfe, as a plant comes
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:96743:99"/>of a plant, and a Lyon of a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and aequivocall generation of unlike, as when a plant or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creature is bred of putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as, Mice, Flies, Serpents, and the like, for the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the kinde, for nature ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth at the higheſt perfection that can be, even to continue all creatures for ever; and therefore every creature naturally deſires ever to be, which becauſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be effected in the individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, therefore it is done another way, namely, by propagation, for to beget the like, is after a ſort to be ever. And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, this is done by the ſeede of generation, which as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty it ſelfe is moſt excellent: ſo is the matter of it the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of mans nature, as the ſeed of a tree, the ſap whereof hath paſſed through roote, body, branch, leafe, bud, and all: and ſo conteines the nature of the whole: ſo is the ſeede of man
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:96743:99"/>the quinteſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of nature, which having paſſed through all the degrees of concoction, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining the whole kinde of man, is reſerved by nature in a place convenient for the procreation of another of the ſame kinde. Now becauſe this generation is the affection or rather perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the whole compound, conſiſting of matter and forme, a man cannot be ſaid to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the matter alone, but the whole creature, ſo as to ſpeake properly, generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not either of the matter, or of the forme, but of a certaine third thing, conſiſting of matter and forme. So that here it followeth, that our propagation from <hi>Adam,</hi> is nothing elſe but the deduction of the whole man out of <hi>Adam,</hi> according to the courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; that is, the turning of our potentiall being in him into act by naturall generation, which is the onely meanes whereby <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi>

               <p>Firſt, Creation is the worke of God by himſelfe; Generation is the worke of nature from God: Secondly, Creation is wrought onely by the word &amp; command of God by his onely becke and will; generation is performed in a naturall order pre-ordeined of God.<note place="margin">Vide <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan. Synt. lib.</hi> 5.6.2.</note> Thirdly, Creation is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of nothing, not of any matter or ſubſtance, but of nothing at all; generation is of ſome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pre-exiſting indeede, old matter putting on new formes. Fourthly, Creation is done in a moment, without any time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by an infinite vertue, which is not capable of any time; gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration cannot be but in time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfected by degrees and in ſucceſſion of time. Fifthly, In
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:96743:100"/>Creation, things are not made of the ſame ſubſtance with the creator; but in generation, that which is generated, hath the ſame ſubſtance with the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Sixthly, Creation is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without any motion or mutation; but in generation, there is both motion and muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſame matter being va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into diverſitie of formes. Laſtly, the order of creation is one, and of generation another; for in creation the privation is before the habit, power before act, darkneſſe before light; but in generation, the habit is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the privation, ſight before blindneſſe, &amp; light before dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And ſo much for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall deſcription of Originall ſin, Creation, and Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

For the ſoule ceaſing to be good, it muſt needs become evill; and being turned out of the right way, goes on in a wrong; for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand ſtill or be idle, but muſt be doing either good or evill, and therefore being deprived of goodneſſe, corruption follows as darkneſſe ſucceeds in the place of light.</p>

And as that depravation or corruption onely is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly originall ſin, and guiltineſſe comes onely by reaſon of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; ſo propagation onely is properly the meanes whereby it is derived unto us, and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is onely in regard of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation. For as we ſhould not have beene guilty, if we had not beene corrupt; ſo ſin ſhould not have been imputed, if it had not beene propagated. And as we were potentially guilty in <hi>Adam,</hi>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:96743:102"/>becauſe potentially corrupt; ſo by like reaſon it followeth, that it is now actually imputed to us, becauſe we are actually propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him.

I deny not but it may be ſaid, but I cannot ſee how it can be ſaid truely. For what can be more falſe and abſurd, than to ſay the whole was in <hi>Adam,</hi> but not the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall parts, whereof the whole conſiſteth. And indeed ſuch a manner of being muſt be an idle imagination, or nothing, for it is impoſſible to be either really
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:96743:125"/>or rationally. But what is their reaſon? man gives the ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence to the perſon, and the ſoule comes from <hi>Adam quoad exiſtentiam,</hi> though not <hi>quoad eſſentiam.</hi> But I deny this too: man does indeed ſomething in the ſubſiſtence of the perſon, but that (as they ſay) is onely to provide, I know not what, a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (it ſhould be) without a form; which at the moſt is but the leaſt part, and therfore not the whole nor halfe.</p>

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:96743:126"/>and they did unite them, would it follow that the conjunction of both, makes both to come from <hi>Adam?</hi> Why doe they not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther come both from God, and not at all from <hi>Adam?</hi> it were more reaſon the greater ſhould draw the leſſer, than the leſſe the greater; &amp; that the baſer ſhould attend the more noble, rather than the moſt noble to waite on the baſer: verily if the whole man may be properly ſaid to proceed from <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe the body doth; much more may the whole man be ſaid to proceed from God, becauſe the ſoule doth. The vanitie of this reaſon (that the whole man comes from <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe the body doth) may appeare by the like. If a lame man ſhould have a woodden leg joyned to his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> might it be ſaid his whole body grew in the wood, becauſe his leg did? nothing leſſe. And yet is not the woodden leg ſo

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, That Chriſts ſoule comes not immediately from God; for
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:96743:131"/>then the greateſt part of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie ſhould have beene from the holy Ghoſt: becauſe all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall workes of God are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to each perſon in Trinitie.</p>

               <p>But that which I doe eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conclude from hence is, that if the holy Ghoſt cannot be Chriſts father, becauſe he gave not the matter of his humanitie, Chriſt cannot be the ſon of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> nor <hi>David</hi> according to the promiſe: no nor the ſon of man (and ſo no Saviour) unleſſe he receive the matter of his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie (whereof the ſoule is the chiefe part) from them. And herein indeed they ſpeake the truth, for it is impoſſible to be a naturall father to that whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we give not the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:96743:132"/>yea and forme too: as wee ſhall ſee when wee come to the rules of nature, which God hath inſtituted, and from whence the truth of this is alſo to be fetched.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How Chriſt was true man.</note>I conclude therefore, that Chriſts whole humanitie, both ſoule and body, was traduced from <hi>Adam:</hi> that is, deduced out of his ſubſtance, though not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the common manner, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated from the perſon of the Virgin onely by the miraculous worke of the holy Ghoſt, which uſeth to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from both ſexes in ordinary generation. And though a ſoule cannot by the power of nature be produced of one ſoule, no more than a body: yet it being performed by ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall power, it is a true ſoule no leſſe than the body is a true body; and both together makes a true man, no leſſe than <hi>Eve</hi> was a true woman (whom <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> called <hi>bone of his bone,</hi>

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:96743:133"/>that the holy Ghoſt did ſanctifie a part of the Virgins ſubſtance, which was then aſſumed by the divine nature to make the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt. Which words muſt be warily interpreted, and wiſely underſtood, for by a part, we are not to underſtand a part of her body onely, but of her whole perſon aſwell ſoule as bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whereof his humanitie was formed: and by ſanctifying, we are not to imagine cleanſing it from ſin, but only the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to this holy purpoſe, and endowing it with gifts fitting ſuch a divine union.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Meere ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be capable of ſinne, becauſe that cannot be without a perſonall ſubſiſtence, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and will to encline and move it ſelfe to good or evill: which meere ſubſtance ſimply conſidered cannot doe, whether it be of the ſoule or body.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Sin is not eſſentiall to the nature of man, but onely an accident or evill qualitie,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:96743:134"/>cleaving to the perſon of him in whom it is, and ſo cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ſaid to the ſubſtance of mans nature.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, If every part of mans ſubſtance ſhould be ſinfull, then it followes that the haires upon our heads are even infected with it, and much more ſuch abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives as periſh before the ſoules infuſion: and conſequently muſt all riſe at the day of Judgement againe to ſuffer (without Chriſts ſarisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) infinite puniſhments.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly, It is manifeſt it could have no actuall ſin, and originall ſin is not of that nature (as was before ſhewed) that it cannot come to us neither by the ſoule nor body, nor union of both, if it be created: and by propagation onely; if it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated; for which cauſe Chriſt onely was freed from the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe of propagation.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Laſtly, If meere ſubſtances be ſinfull, it cannot be ſhifted but Chriſt was infected with origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſin; for his ſubſtance was in <hi>Adam,</hi> in as much as he was his ſonne, and ſo by this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine muſt needs be ſinfull.<note place="margin">This doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine not ſo well cleared of old.</note> But this ſeemes to be graunted by Divines, and therefore they ſay, that the holy Ghoſt did in the ſame moment that it was aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, cleanſe that maſſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of his body was made from ſin: and ſo it was ſanctified from the firſt conception in the Virgins wombe. Whereof we give this reaſon, that it became not the eternall ſonne of God perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to aſſume unto himſelfe a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſtained, defiled, and pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſin. And farther they ſay, that indeed <hi>Mary</hi> was a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but the maſſe of fleſh which was taken out of her ſubſtance, was at the ſame inſtant ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the operation of the holy Ghoſt. So that it is graunted,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:96743:136"/>that the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce wherof Chriſts humanitie was made, was ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full before it was aſſumed. This point not being ſo well cleared, hath much troubled the Church in former ages: being aſſailed with divers dangerous errours, why elſe did the <hi>Marcionites</hi> and <hi>Manichees</hi> hold that Chriſt had an incorporeall or heavenly body; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was not take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the Virgin, but only paſſed through her? and what elſe cauſed <hi>Apolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narius</hi> to hold; that Chriſt had no humane ſoule, but only a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which was inſould with the deity, but to free him from ſin?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. If it had been ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified.</note>That we may therefore fully cleare this truth from all ſuch phantaſticall opinions; I deny that it can be truly and properly ſaid that Chriſts humanitie was ever ſinfull. And not onely for the former reaſons, but becauſe if it had beene ſinfull, it could never have beene ſanctifièd; the Sonne of God could never have
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:96743:136"/>beene incarnate, nor any man ever ſaved. For who ſhould have purged away that ſin? the holy Ghoſt? nay; there is one onely <hi>Mediatour between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.5.</note> 
                  <hi>and it is through his blood that wee have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 1.7.</note> 
                  <hi>even the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 1.14.20.</note> 
                  <hi>and it is the blood of his croſſe, that reconcileth all things.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.2.</note> And againe,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.22.</note> it is the <hi>ſprinkling of the blood of Chriſt</hi> that giveth power to the purging away of ſin: and therefore alſo it is ſaid, that <hi>without ſhedding of blood there is no remiſſion.</hi> So that the bloud of Chriſt onely cleanſeth from ſin. Yea, but the holy Ghoſt alſo ſanctifies. It is true,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> Mat. 3.11. Ioh. 3.5. Rom. 8.14</note> the holy Ghoſt doth now ſanctifie the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, purg out ſin, &amp; infuſe grace: but all by vertue of Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. For if he had not firſt (I meane in the order of nature) take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away the guilt by his bloud no man could have been ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Spirit. Now this he
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:96743:137"/>could not doe by his own huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, for it was impoſſible that he ſhuld purge ſin, by that blood which he had not: &amp; therfore if it had been neceſſary, that Chriſt ſhould have take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away the guilt &amp; corruption of his own nature, (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> could not be but by the ſame nature taken) before he tooke it; it had been impoſſible, that ever Chriſt could have bin incarnate.

Now then if his ſubſtance was never ſinfull, the worke of the holy Ghoſt herein was not to cleanſe it from ſin, but to ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was not ſinfull in it ſelfe, from a ſinfull creature, that ſo being free, it might be aſſured by the divine nature, &amp; ſubſiſt in the perſon of the ſame.</p>

If it be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid, that though he be not ſinfull as Chriſt, nor yet as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the meer ſubſtance of man: yet he muſt needs be ſinfull as his ſubſtance was belonging to the perſon of corrupt <hi>Adam,</hi> in whom it was, and afterwards to the ſinfull Virgin; that cannot be neither. For though it were ſinfull as a part of their perſons, yet as it was ſo it was none of
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:96743:138"/>his. Chriſt never aſſumed the perſon of the Virgin (for one perſon ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be another though ſin were not) but he tooke her nature or ſubſtance only, which becauſe it was good in it ſelfe, though ſinfull as hers, the holy Ghoſt did ſeperate it (by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſuall courſe) from belonging to her perſon (and ſo being by it ſelfe it was ſinleſſe) and then it was inſtantly aſſumed by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Word, and ſo made the perſon of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and that in the ſame moment that it was: being by that union enriched w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ſupernaturall gifts, and exalted above all men and Angels. And thus alſo was his ſubſtance ſinleſſe, although it was the ſubſtance of the ſinfull Virgin. And to conclude,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.29. 1 Pet. 1.19.</note> thus is he the immaculate <hi>Lambe that taketh away the ſinnes of the world.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Why his concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now all this was effected by the immediate working of the holy Ghoſt at the inſtant of his
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:96743:139"/>conception. For it neither might nor could be performed after the manner of mans ſinfull propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.<note place="margin">1. It could not be by man.</note> Becauſe if man had mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred the matter of his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie after the ordinary way, it ſhould have been ſinfull in part: that is, as man gave it to be a part of Chriſts perſon, or indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the ſubſiſtence of that nature in the perſon of the Son, which nature alone would have made a perſon, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſinner. For by the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in ordinary generation, ſo much as man begets another perſon, he begets another ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner (which yet if the ſoule were immediatly created, were ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, as there could be no origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſin, as we heard before.) So that by propagation the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Chriſt which is the whol perſon, ſo farre as man could in this cauſe have effected, ſhould have beene ſinfull. And though not meerely as humanitie, yet
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:96743:139"/>as a nature ſinfully propagated from man, wherewith it was impoſſible the divine nature ſhould be united. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it could not be by man: and the Virgin neither might nor could conceive alone (for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption muſt have no hand in it) it was neceſſary therefore that it ſhould be done by the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall power of God.

And if we will hearken to nature, I doubt not to make
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:96743:141"/>it appeare, that there is nothing more manifeſt in nature, than this mediate manner of the ſouls propagation: and when as well nature as divinite concludes for it, I ſee not with what reaſon it can be gainſaid.</p>

For wee ſee that all naturall things, yea every plant that growes out of the earth, beſides the materiall cauſe the elements, whereof it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and the ſeede whence it receiveth the forme, hath

As firſt, the often failing, and indeed rareneſſe of humane conception in compariſon of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures, as common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teacheth. Now if the ſoule be created after the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the body, then the firſt conception and breeding beeing by the power of nature onely, why ſhoud there not bee as much frequency and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the propagation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind as of other creatures? This rareneſſe of humane conception doth intimate unto us, that it is not by the power of nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone that man is conceived in
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:96743:154"/>the wombe, but that there is ſome more ſpeciall worke of God in it, than in the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of other creatures. And if it cannot be denyed but God hath ſuch a ſpeciall worke in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of man, why ſhould we not thinke that the ſoule hath its beginning then alſo, rather than (with reverence be it ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) to put God to a double la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and to ſet him twice on worke in every man genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.

And yet this muſt needs be, if God create ſoules af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the forming of the body; for then the former being done by the power of nature, God ſhall be bound to give ſoules imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately whenſoever nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth bodyes: unleſſe hee ſhould ſuffer children to be born without ſoules or corrupt and kill their bodyes before they be informed, (and ſo indanger their mothers too) both which are both againſt nature and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Whereas if this mediate manner be admitted, this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not juſtly be objected, for as much as God ſhall not then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce mans ſoule according to a particular immediate and new creation: but according to his almighty bleſſing, powerfull or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and conſtant conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

               <p>The Objections are theſe foure:<note place="margin">Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, That the ſoule ſhall not be immortall, if it may be reſolved into a former princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, namely, <hi>Adams</hi> ſoule from whence all came.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God ſhall hereby ſtill worke immediately in the creation of ſoules, and ſo ſhall not yet have ended his worke, and reſt from his labours.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Man ſhall ſtill be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to beaſts, in that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beget his like alone, but muſt have more helpe from God than they.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, God ſhall ſtill be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with ſin, in being the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate efficient of our ſinfull

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Obj.</hi> That the ſoule muſt be mortall if it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from another.</note>For the firſt, firſt, although it is true, that all mixt bodyes may be againe reſolved into their former principles the elements, whereof they are compounded, and out of which they ariſe: yet this is no impeachment to the ſoules immortalitie. For the compariſon is unequall, and the cauſes nothing like, unleſſe wee ſhould ſay that all bodyes muſt returne into <hi>Adams</hi> alſo, whence they came as well as ſoules.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Mixt bodyes are not the ſimple elements, but compounded of them: where as our ſoules are of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and no leſſe ſimple than his was.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If it were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, yea, even of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet it would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently follow, that it muſt needs be mortall, becauſe corruption and death comes not onely, nor

               <p>Laſtly, To this objection I will oppoſe an infallible conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>viz.</hi> that nothing can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to nothing, but by the ſame meanes whereby it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the firſt being. And hence it is that all creatures that are produced out of the elements by the power of nature, doe by nature reſolve into them againe: but becauſe mens ſoules cannot be propagated from their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, but by the immediate power of GOD concurring, hence it neceſſarily followeth, that neither can they be againe diſſolved or annihilated but by the ſame omnipotent power. This therefore doth invincibly prove, ſo farre is it from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:96743:161"/>proving the ſoules immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</p>

               <p>Laſtly, This worke is no part of creation properly, but of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, which is ordinarily either mediate or immediate Mediate, ſo all elementary crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

And by the ſame immediate power it muſt needs be that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of ſoule is conſerved: the excellency of whoſe nature, is ſuch as can have no naturall or mediate efficient cauſe, and therefore of neceſſitie it muſt be his immediate providence one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that even by courſe of nature.</p>

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:96743:162"/>more than he; and that he doth as much in the generation of his like, as any other creatures doe in theirs. For it is well knowne, that in generation, beſides the matter and forme, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the generators, it is neceſſary that there ſhould bee an efficient power, comming from an externall cauſe, which all grant to be the influence of the celeſtiall Orbes; whence is that common Proverb amongſt Philoſophers; <hi>Sol &amp; homo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant hominem;</hi> now ſeeing man gives the matter and forme of the whole man, ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, though in regard of his ſoule, he hath a more excellent efficient than they, or rather the ſame efficient after a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent manner, that is, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately: this is ſo farre from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraging, that it exalteth mans nature above all other creatures in the world. Nevertheleſſe, if man did not give both matter
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:96743:162"/>and forme, this were indeed juſtly objected, and he ſhould be herein according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature inferiour to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as we heard before.</p>

                  <note place="margin">4. <hi>Obj.</hi> That God ſhall ſtill be touched with ſin.</note>Laſtly, The laſt objection, that God ſhall be touched with ſinne in being the immediate efficient of our ſinfull ſoules, is eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: for God is ſimply the efficient cauſe of the ſoule, and not of ſin, but that comes from our corrupt parents, who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the matter of the whole man, corrupt and ſinfull like themſelves.

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:96743:163"/>albeit God ſtill performes his part as perfectly as ever, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of his efficient power for the producing of them.
